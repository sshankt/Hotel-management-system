#🏨 S.K.T Restaurant Ordering System
Welcome to the S.K.T Restaurant Ordering System! 
This Python-based project simulates a restaurant ordering system where users can browse different menus, place their orders, 
and get a final bill. The system is designed to handle various categories of food items like Starters, Pasta, Burgers, and Dosa, making it a complete solution for a restaurant simulation.

##📋 Features
Interactive Menu: The user can view the available food items categorized into Starters, Pasta, Burgers, and Dosa.
Dynamic Order System: Allows users to order multiple items, showing real-time updates on the ordered items and their prices.
Bill Generation: Automatically calculates the total order cost and displays a detailed bill at the end of the session.
User-Friendly Navigation: Users can easily navigate through the menu options and place their orders with clear prompts.
##🚀 How It Works
Starter Menu: The system begins by displaying a starter menu with various items like pizza, coffee, and cold drinks.
Select Category: Users can then choose from Pasta, Burger, Dosa, or additional Starters.
Place Orders: After selecting a category, users can add items to their order by typing the item's name.
Generate Bill: Once the user is done ordering, the system calculates the total price and generates a bill with a detailed breakdown.
